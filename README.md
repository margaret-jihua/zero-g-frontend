## You don't use it, you lose it 

In the year of 2100, commercial travaling to space is as normal as a trip to the beach. Everyday people are flying off into space and with that is the preparation and consistent exercising to maintain your muscles and bone density. By research, you muscular density decreases by 11-16% when youâ€™re in space. Zero-G is here to help you maintain a healthy body on your multi-planetary travels.
